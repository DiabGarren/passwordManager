# Overview

This password manager is a GUI application that allows the user to view, create, update and delete passwords for different services.
The passwords are stored in a .ini file which is read to display the information.
All the passwords are run through a custom encryption algorithm before being stored.

I created this program as a way to further my understanding of Java.
